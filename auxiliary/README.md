# Auxiliary files

In this folder we have two auxiliary files.

The first one is the `exceptions.json`. This file have some games with errors that were treated manually (looking online for correct data and fixing). As commented in initial page, we won't continue looking for the correct data and fixing in this file, but all update is welcome.

The second file, `scrape.log`, have the log of all execution. It's a simple log file, only with start and end of each step, in addition to a little information about how many documents were added.
